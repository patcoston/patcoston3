Install React Router for TypeScript
https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/react-router-typescript
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest @types/react-router-dom
npm audit fix

Some React Router DOM things were not installed for example
Module '"react-router-dom"' has no exported member 'Switch'.ts(2305)
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom

npm install react-router-dom
v6.4.1
https://medium.com/@manishsundriyal/whats-new-in-react-router-v6-20eefe665be9


npm uninstall react-router-dom
npm uninstall -D react-router-dom
npm uninstall -save-dev react-router-dom

 npm install
 Adding the Typescript compiler,
 instal @types packages.
 Each @types package contains inside it several .d.ts files which provide the actual type information for libraries installed from NPM.

npm install --save-dev @types/blah-blah
